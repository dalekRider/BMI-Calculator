# BMI-Calculator

<h2>BMI Calculator Codewars solution</h2>

<p>So going through my emails I noticed one of codewars weekly challenges was a BMI calculator. This is my current attempt and it works!
  
Right now it is simply a script that you can run in console which prompts your input for weight and height, then outputs an alert to provide your BMI index and its classification. AS it stands not it only calculates based on English measurments and not metric

There are few things that need to be updated for this to be fully functioning.

<ul>
  <li>Allow the user to enter height in feet and inches then convert to inches</li>
  <li>Allow user to choose between English or Metric and then calculate based on that</li>
  <li>Input Validation, currently only return error info on alert for final calc and does not ask for input again</li>
</ul>

<strong>Possible Upcoming Changes and Improvements:</strong><br />
<ul>
  <li>Use forms instead of prompts</li>
  <li>Responses returned through updated DOM on page instead of alerts</li>
  <li>Styled Page</li>
  <li>Return helpful links based on results</li>
  <li>ES6 maybe use switch/case</li>
</ul>
<br />

Thanks for looking and Good luck out there!</p>
